        Typically, when a user interacts with a website, such as searching 
        for an item or filtering the search results, a SQL template is used 
        for which the user input gets added. By using an AI that translates 
        natural language into SQL queries, the initial search results based 
        on the keywords passed will most likely be tailored to the user's 
        wishes, providing better search results initially without the need 
        to interact with filters. To ensure regulatory compliance, such as 
        not being able to use passwords as a search criterion, we assert 
        the Fair Information Practice Principles and try to present an AI 
        that can easily be integrated into an existing code/database.
