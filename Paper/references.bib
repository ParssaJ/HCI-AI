Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBs are then discussed, comparing NLIDBs to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBs have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBs), and NLIDBs with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBs. The paper ends with reflections on the current state of the art.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1908.08564},
	abstract = {In e-commerce, a user tends to search for the desired product by issuing a query to the search engine and examining the retrieved results. If the search engine was successful in correctly understanding the user's query, it will return results that correspond to the products whose attributes match the terms in the query that are representative of the query's product intent. However, the search engine may fail to retrieve results that satisfy the query's product intent and thus degrading user experience due to different issues in query processing: (i) when multiple terms are present in a query it may fail to determine the relevant terms that are representative of the query's product intent, and (ii) it may suffer from vocabulary gap between the terms in the query and the product's description, i.e., terms used in the query are semantically similar but different from the terms in the product description. Hence, identifying the terms that describe the query's product intent and predicting additional terms that describe the query's product intent better than the existing query terms to the search engine is an essential task in e-commerce search. In this paper, we leverage the historical query reformulation logs of a major e-commerce retailer to develop distant-supervised approaches to solve both these problems. Our approaches exploit the fact that the significance of a term is dependent upon the context (other terms in the neighborhood) in which it is used in order to learn the importance of the term towards the query's product intent. We show that identifying and emphasizing the terms that define the query's product intent leads to a 3\% improvement in ranking. Moreover, for the tasks of identifying the important terms in a query and for predicting the additional terms that represent product intent, experiments illustrate that our approaches outperform the non-contextual baselines.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

	abstract = {A significant amount of the world's knowledge is stored in relational databases. However, the ability for users to retrieve facts from a database is limited due to a lack of understanding of query languages such as SQL. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding SQL queries. Our model leverages the structure of SQL queries to significantly reduce the output space of generated queries. Moreover, we use rewards from in-the-loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate unordered parts of the query, which we show are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. In addition, we will publish WikiSQL, a dataset of 80654 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries distributed across 24241 tables from Wikipedia. This dataset is required to train our model and is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy-based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to WikiSQL, our model Seq2SQL outperforms attentional sequence to sequence models, improving execution accuracy from 35.9\% to 59.4\% and logical form accuracy from 23.4\% to 48.3\%.},

	abstract = {When translating natural language questions into SQL queries to answer questions from a database, contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas. The generalization challenge lies in (a) encoding the database relations in an accessible way for the semantic parser, and (b) modeling alignment between database columns and their mentions in a given query. We present a unified framework, based on the relation-aware self-attention mechanism, to address schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation within a text-to-SQL encoder. On the challenging Spider dataset this framework boosts the exact match accuracy to 57.2\%, surpassing its best counterparts by 8.7\% absolute improvement. Further augmented with BERT, it achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 65.6\% on the Spider leaderboard. In addition, we observe qualitative improvements in the model's understanding of schema linking and alignment. Our implementation will be open-sourced at https://github.com/Microsoft/rat-sql.},
